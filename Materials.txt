================
Querying for time (using Jerry's app on w5d1):

time_range = (Time.now.midnight - 1.day)..Time.now.midnight
Post.where("created_at" => time_range)
Post.includes(:comments).where("comments.created_at" => time_range)


in Sublime (inside the relevant model):
- scope :one_week_before, lambda { |time| where(published_at: (time.ago(1.week)..time))}
in console:
- Post.one_week_before(Time.now)

also:
- params = {time: Time.parse("01/01/2014")}
(time by default - European: day/month/year)
- Post.one_week_before(params[:time])

To show data without passing the scope:
- Post.unscoped

To show future events (if default shows only past events)
In model:
scope :will_be_published, where("published_at > ?", Time.now)
In console:
Post.unscoped.will_be_published
